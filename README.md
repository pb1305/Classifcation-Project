# Classifcation-Project
The goal of this project is to explore the Airline Passenger Satisfaction survey data from Kaggle 
(https://www.kaggle.com/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction) and analyze which features are strong predictors of passenger satisfaction. 
This analysis can be leveraged by the airline company to identify which services or features are most pertinent to a passenger and how 
they can leveraged to attract additional customer or improve customer ratings.
